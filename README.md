## Definition of your audience:
  Anyone who is interested in the correlation between cost of living and global happiness index

## Definition statement: 
I want to create a web application that would help someone choose a place to live based on the global happiness index and cost of living

## High level story (elevator pitch): 
Figuring out where to live can be difficult.  Using data based on happiness and cost of living, I wanted to try to take the guess work out of accessing if a location is a good place to live.
## Outline of the content

## User Flow

## Wireframes (1 wireframe per page minimum, hand-drawn is ok!)

## Color pallet

## Site navigation and Nav elements like buttons

## Any third party APIs that will be used
